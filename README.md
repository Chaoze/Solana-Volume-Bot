ü§ô Important Notes
‚è© The bot runs until funds are depleted or the user pauses the bot. Remaining funds can be withdrawn by using the deposit wallet's private key. A restart incurs the restart fees mentioned above.

‚è© By default, the volume is distributed across a number of wallets determined by the SOL deposited, with a maximum of 20 wallets.

‚è© For example, depositing 10 SOL (after 4 SOL fees) leaves 6 SOL to be divided among 12 wallets (each with 0.5 SOL). If more than 10 SOL are deposited, the available SOL is divided among a maximum of 20 wallets with larger amounts in each wallet.
